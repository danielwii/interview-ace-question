  As the philanthropic powerhouse led by Bill and Melinda Gates explained in their latest
  annual letter to the public, it ended its effort to overhaul teacher evaluation systems after determining that these efforts were failing to generate intended results.
  
  ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen the large impact we had hoped for,‚Äù the Microsoft founder and his wife
  wrote in the note they published in February.

  It‚Äôs a familiar storyline. Again and again, policymakers and philanthropists have teamed up to reform public education, only to find that their bold projects have fallen short.
  
  Like other educational policy scholars, we have observed this pattern for years. And we have
  identified a few reasons why school reform efforts so persistently get lackluster results,
  despite consistent bipartisan support and roughly US$4 billion a year in philanthropic funding derived from some of the nation‚Äôs biggest fortunes.`;
